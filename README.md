# JAVAFX_SWING_Chat_App
University based chatting app designed to share academic information among teachers and students.

To use this project, first goto "MoodleProjectServer" and run the "server_frame.java" file. I used Netbeans and swing for GUI. Start the server.

Then goto "MoodleProject" and run the "MooldeProject.java" file. This will pop up UI for login. If not registered, you can register here. If you are already registered, you can login. This GUI is built with JAVAFX.

I did not use any database here, just simple text file to save all the informations and chatting history.

Enjoy!!!
